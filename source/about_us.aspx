            ISPWAD(Integrate security and performance aspects for Web-based applications) framework
            for solving security events and improving processing performance issues of Web-based
            applications on the Intranet.</p>
        <p>
            ISPWAD which combines SWAP(Secure Web Applications Project) and RBAC (Role-Based
            Access Control)frameworks. The purposes of proposed ISPWAD are to fix the security
            holes and improve the processing performance during designof Web based application</p>
        <p>
            Presently, there are still many researches about security solutions in Web-based
            applications. But, we can identify that previous researches do not have proposed
            a complete case for solving the security issue and improving the performance problem.
            The proposed ISPWAD of this paper is to integrate SWAP and RBAC approaches to provide
            a total solution for eliminating security risk and improving system throughput in
            designing Web-based applications. The purposes of ISPWAD approach are to fix the
            security holes and improve the processing performance during in designing Web-based
            applications.</p>
